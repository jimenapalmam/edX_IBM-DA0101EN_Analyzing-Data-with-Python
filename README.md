edX_IBM DA0101EN_Analyzing Data with Python

This course will take you from the basics of Python to exploring many different types of data. 
You will learn how to prepare data for analysis, perform simple statistical analysis, create meaningful data visualizations, predict future trends from data, and more! 

Topics covered: 

1) Importing Data Sets 

2) Cleaning the Data 

3) Data Frame Manipulation 

4) Summarizing the Data 

5) Building Machine Learning Regression Models 

6) Building Data Pipelines 

Analyzing Data with Python will be delivered through lecture, lab, and assignments and includes the following parts: 

Data Analysis libraries: will learn to use Pandas, Numpy and Scipy libraries to work with a sample data set. 
We will introduce you to pandas, an open-source library, and we will use it to load, manipulate, analyze, and visualize cool data sets. 
Then we will introduce you to another open-source library, scikit-learn, and we will use some of its machine learning algorithms to build smart models and make cool predictions.
